# Built-in blog plugin

The blog plugin makes it very easy to build a blog, either as a sidecar to
your documentation or as the main thing. Focus on your content while the plugin
does all the heavy lifting, generating a view of all latest posts, [archive] and
[category] pages, configurable [pagination] and much more.
